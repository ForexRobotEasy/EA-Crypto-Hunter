## How It Works
This EA uses a unique mathematical algorithm to identify zones of price accumulation and determine the trend direction. It places a pending order with a stop loss and take profit based on the current price and the specified gap protection. If the pending order is placed successfully, it checks if the order needs to be modified based on the exit threshold.
